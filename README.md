# AFTV-LRR (Single-cell RNA-seq Clustering)

This repository provides an implementation of **AFTV-LRR**, a clustering method for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data based on **low-rank representation (LRR)** and **adaptive fractional total variation (AFTV)** regularization. The code supports running AFTV-LRR on multiple public scRNA-seq datasets and comparing it with several representative clustering baselines.

> If you use this code in your research, please cite our paper (see [Citation](#citation)).

## Highlights

- **AFTV-LRR** for scRNA-seq clustering (LRR + adaptive fractional TV regularization)
- Supports running experiments on multiple datasets
- Evaluation metrics commonly used in scRNA-seq clustering (e.g., **ARI**, etc.)
- Includes scripts for spectral clustering on the learned similarity/representation matrix
- Easy entry point: `main.m`
